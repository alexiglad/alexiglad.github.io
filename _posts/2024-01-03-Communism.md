Why does communism fail?

## A Potential Solution to the Perils of Communism
01/03/2024


#### Motivation
Reward is at the epicenter of our behavior as agents in this closed feedback loop we call our universe. Reward serves as a reinforcement signal in driving behavior, providing further motivation to pursue an objective. It's from this perspective that we will analyze the flaws of communism and use it to consequently propose a potential solution.


#### Communism

When I first started learning about communism I thought it was a beautiful idea. The concept of a utopian society with no inequality/inequity and where everyone has equal opportunity appealed to my idealistic nature. So what was the catch--why was/is the U.S. government so against such an ideology?

Throughout several lectures on Russia, China, and other communist governments the propaganda of U.S. schools began to answer this question for me with a cold hard reality check. *It never works.*

So why does communism never work?



<!-- most issues with communism stem from corruption in the government, so this is the problem we aim to solve -->

#### A Potential Solution

We know that 
<!-- make it so anyone in power agrees to live humbly after
    aka money/income capped to median american income, give away all -->

Thank you to Sion Kim for helping me brainstorm this random idea during a lunch.
