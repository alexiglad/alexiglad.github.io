[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08862)

**TLDR:** 

We developed a new approach for Autoregressive (AR)/world modeling called Energy-Based World Models (EBWM).

This is inspired by several facets of human cognition, such as System 2 thinking from psychology (which is prolonged, deliberate, and dynamic thinking). Existing AR approaches cannot achieve all cognitive facets discussed in the paper while EBWM can.

**EBWM scaled better than traditional autoregressive transformers** in data efficiency and GPU hours at sequence modeling in CV.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved amazing feats, but still struggle to reason and plan.
So how can we train LLMs, and more broadly, world models to reason and plan like humans? Our new work, [Cognitively Inspired Energy-Based World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08862), aims to address this.

To understand why current LLMs/world models cannot reason and plan at the level of humans, consider the two questions below:

What is 2 + 2?

What is 67 * 54?

These questions vary drastically in difficulty---the first you could probably solve without even deliberately thinking but the second would take deliberate mathematical reasoning. Yet, most existing world models are trained to make every prediction with a fixed amount of computational resources (If you're thinking CoT is a counterexample to this keep reading!) As humans, we naturally adjust the computational resources we use towards the difficulty of the problem, which is more broadly referred to as System 2 thinking in psychology. 

We trained world models to be able to approximate this System 2 like thinking, through developing 'Energy-Based World Models' (EBWM). Not only are these models able to dynamically allocate compute based on the difficulty of a given problem during inference, but they can also achieve several other facets of cognition not possible with existing traditional autoregressive approaches (e.g. Autoregressive Transformers, RNNs, Diffusion Transformers, etc).

This matters, because it provides a promising path towards training world models that can truly think, reason, and plan, at the same level as humans---a problem I'm confident is one of the largest blockers towards achieving human-level intelligence/AGI.

Before we continue, let's review what some of the topics we'll be discussing are.

**World Models:**
Intuitively, world models are predictive models of the world. They have learned various laws of physics, such as gravity, and know how people move, how the sun sets, and various other aspects of the world. The world models that our paper focused on are a specific instance of world models where there are several sensory inputs (i.e. multiple video frames) and the model is trained to predict the next sensory input (i.e. the next frame) \[[1](#1)\]. Mathematically, this is equivalent to the following:

$$
x(t+1) = F(x(1), x(2), \ldots, x(t))
$$

Where x(1) ... x(t+1) are sensory inputs (i.e. different video frames) and F is the function being learned. 

**Energy-Based Models:**
Energy-Based Models (EBMs) assign a scalar value, called the energy, to each configuration of inputs to a model. The key idea is that configurations with lower energy are more probable and compatible with each other, while those with higher energy are less likely. The goal of an EBM is to learn an energy function that gives lower energy to "correct" or "desirable" configurations, like real data points, and higher energy to "incorrect" or "undesirable" ones, like noise or outliers.

In the context of world models trained as EBMs, you can think of this energy as how probable/compatible the *predicted next state* is with the *context/past*. 

For example, if the given context was a video of a red ball flying up through the air, a *high* energy continuation may be a video of a dog chewing on its toy, while a *low* energy continuation might be a red ball flying down through the air. This red ball flying down through the air is more compatible with the context, which implies lower energy.

**Markov Chain Monte Carlo:** EBMs trained with neural networks (NNs) have some cool characteristics. Since NNs are fully differentiable, these models can use a method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Simply put, MCMC under the context of EBMs is a technique that helps models start from random noise and iteratively improve upon their predictions. It does this by minimizing the learned energy function, or by backpropagating the gradient from the energy scalar to the input being improved upon. You can think about this intuitively as asking the model, "How can I adjust this input to improve its likeliness", and the model telling you how to adjust each and every aspect of the input (i.e. each pixel in the video frame) to minimize the energy and therefore increase that input's compatibility with the other inputs.

Now, let's take a look at EBWM in NLP and CV (note that we visualize words and images for NLP and CV respectively, but note that this is all done at the token/embedding level):

![EBWM in NLP and CV](/assets/ebwm.png)

The orange boxes here represent the context. The yellow boxes represent the predicted future state (which starts as random noise). First, EBWM predicts the energy of the initially predicted future state (which is likely to be high since it is random noise). Then, using MCMC, this prediction is iteratively improved upon. 

### So what other feats can EBWM achieve that existing autoregressive approaches can't?

The paper discusses four capabilities, which are listed below:
* Predictions shape internal state
* Evaluation of predictions
* Dynamic allocation of resources
* Modeling uncertainty in continuous state spaces

Traditional autoregressive transformers and RNNs cannot achieve any of these capabilities, while diffusion models can only achieve two. EBWM can achieve all four, and this motivates our pursuance of the EBWM architecture.

### So what are the main technical contributions?

There are four main contributions in the main paper--the first is the proposal of this architecture motivated by facets of human cognition. Hopefully, by now you understand this intuition :).

Second, was the design of an *Energy-Based Transformer.* EBM's have failed to stay mainstream in the era of modern ML, so by developing a parallelizable transformer architecture specifically for EBM's we hope to advance the EBM paradigm. This transformer implementation was a core part of EBWM scaling faster than traditional AR transformers.

Third, we investigated EBWM scaling in CV and NLP.

The fourth, *not discussed much in the main paper* contribution, was the usage of a regularized (by reconstruction) objective rather than a contrastive objective for pre-training. There are existing papers that approached autoregressive modeling with an EBM, but they all used contrastive objectives. Contrastive objectives suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which makes regularized objectives more attractive for scaling.


Thanks to all coauthors for all the help with this work, and I'm super excited to see what this work leads to in the future!
