[Work in Progress]

I found Geoffrey Hinton’s [“Two Paths to Intelligence”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=rGgGOccMEiY&ab_channel=CSERCambridge) talk particularly fascinating. In addition to his strong sense of humor, despite discussing the possible end of the world, I was thoroughly impressed by Dr. Hinton’s ability to reason about the differences in biological and digital intelligence.

One point stuck out to me the most - particularly his point that digital intelligence can be shared rapidly. Currently, it takes less than 30 seconds to upload a mini (not quite as capable as humans yet) digital intelligence using websites such as Github. Once uploaded, almost anyone on the internet can access, download, and use this digital intelligence. This simplified weight sharing takes advantage of the deterministic uniform hardware* of computers.

In contrast, humans cannot currently upload our knowledge to a server. As such, the transfer of biological intelligence occurs through the slow process of communication-based knowledge distillation, where around 39-60 bits of information can be transferred per second \[[1](#1)\]\[[2](#2)\]. This transfer of information in biological intelligence is significantly less than the transfer of information in digital intelligence of billions of bits per second - a number that will only increase overtime. This constraint poses a huge restraint on the growth of human intelligence. Imagine if as children information from the encyclopedia and all scientific papers was immediately transferred to our brains.

Despite the information transfer bottleneck imposed by knowledge distillation, there is a key benefit of this slow knowledge transfer that I will argue has helped make humans successful as a species: increased out-of-distribution generalization - otherwise known as creativity.

The slow building of knowledge within humans begins as a child. Once alive, our world models immediately begin building. By the time we are around 5 years old, and our world models have matured to a state of general understanding, a more structured form of learning is imposed onto us - where we learn in school. In school, distinct topics are taught to us, in an incremental procedure with a precomposed curriculum. This curriculum slowly builds on itself, creating the basis of our understanding in a given subject.

People's understanding of information varies - with some people grasping concepts quickly and intuitively, while others may require more time and structured guidance to fully comprehend the same material.

Digital intelligence was designed to be deterministic. Given the same input, computers, in theory***, should always generate the same output.

The question then becomes - is human hardware being non-uniform enough to significantly increase its ability to generalize and be creative over digital intelligences? Is human intelligence’s potential non-determinism** an advantage? Will we come up with creative ways to increase the creativity capabilities of digital intelligences?

Hypothesis that curriculum learning may be a key for building better extrapolation abilities

\* Not all computer hardware is exactly uniform, however, the underlying mechanisms of a CPU accessing memory remains the same.
\*\* I believe that humans do not impose randomness onto the universe and therefore are completely deterministic. However, this is still a widely debated topic.
