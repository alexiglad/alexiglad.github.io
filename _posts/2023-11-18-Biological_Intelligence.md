I found Geoffrey Hinton’s “Two Paths to Intelligence” talk particularly fascinating. In addition to his strong sense of humor, despite discussing the possible end of the world, I was thoroughly impressed by Dr. Hinton’s ability to reason about the differences in biological and digital intelligence.

One point stuck out to me the most - particularly his point that digital intelligence can be shared rapidly. Currently, it takes less than 30 seconds to upload a mini (not quite as capable as humans yet) digital intelligence using websites such as Github. Once uploaded, almost anyone on the internet can access, download, and use this digital intelligence. This simplified weight sharing takes advantage of the deterministic uniform hardware* of computers.
