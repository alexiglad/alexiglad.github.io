    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Alexi - an ambitious software engineer and researcher driven by an unwavering curiosity about the beautiful world inside us and around us. With a particular interest in representation learning, self-supervised learning, multimodal learning, and energy-based models, I've found my passion in the intricate and evolving field of Machine Learning.<br>
        <br>
        One aspect of my approach that I've found valuable is my commitment and love for continuous growth and learning. I have a knack for self-evaluation, identifying my own mistakes, and refining my internal reasoning system to prevent future missteps. This dedication extends beyond my professional life; it fuels my personal growth as well. I have come to love the cycle of ongoing self-improvement and enjoy pushing the boundaries of my mental fortitude. I warmly welcome criticism, seeing it as an opportunity for further growth.<br>
        <br>
        Life for me isn't just about work. When I'm not delving into the latest AI advancements, I can be found exploring new knowledge domains, staying active with workouts and yoga, or seeking mindfulness through meditation. I love spending quality time with my friends and, of course, thoroughly appreciate the power of a good night's sleep.<br>
        <br>
        I'm always open to new connections, opportunities, and intriguing conversations about all things AI. Feel free to reach out to me at alexi@virginia.edu.
