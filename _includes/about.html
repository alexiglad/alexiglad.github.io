    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Alexi. I am broadly passionate about discovering how we can replicate biological intelligence digitally.         
        <br><br>
        To accomplish this, I am presently working in the realm of general domain-agnostic pre-training approaches, where my areas of focus include representation learning, self-supervised learning, and multimodal learning. As the field develops, I see my primary interest shifting to whatever I believe will yield the highest possible long-term impact in the quest to understand intelligence.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not working, I love working out, climbing, and running. I also enjoy spending time exploring other disciplines--including cognitive science, computational neuroscience, physics, and psychology. At my core, I am a philosophical scientist seeking to understand the universe we live in.

        Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:alexigladstone@gmail.com">alexigladstone at gmail dot com</a> if you'd like to discuss anything related to my research or blogs! 
        <br><br>
        <i>I am also looking for collaborators who are available to work at least 20 hours per week. If you are an extremely motivated 10x engineer seeking to work on world-changing ML research please reach out!</i>
