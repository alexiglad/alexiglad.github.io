    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Alexi, and I am deeply committed to machine learning. 
        <br><br>
        Broadly, I am interested in leveraging intuition from cognitive science in the building of generalist agents. 
        <br><br>
        I am presently working in the realm of vision world models, where my area of focus includes representation learning, self-supervised learning, and multimodal learning.
        <br><br>
        I think long-term about my personal growth and the projects I choose to work on. I frequently ponder the most significant challenges I could tackle that would yield the highest possible long-term impact.
