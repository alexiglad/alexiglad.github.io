    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Alexi, and I am deeply committed to machine learning. 
        <br><br>
        Broadly, I am interested in discovering how we can mimic biological intelligence digitally. 
        <br><br>
        To accomplish this, I am presently working in the realm of world models, where my area of focus includes representation learning, self-supervised learning, and multimodal learning. As the field develops, I see my primary interest shifting to whatever aspect of intelligence I believe is missing.
        <br><br>
        I think long-term about my personal growth and the projects I choose to work on. I frequently ponder the most significant challenges I could tackle that would yield the highest possible long-term impact.
