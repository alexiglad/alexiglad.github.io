    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Alexi. I am broadly passionate in discovering how we can mimic biological intelligence digitally.         
        <br><br>
        To accomplish this, I am presently working in the realm of pretraining approaches for foundation models, where my area of focus includes representation learning, self-supervised learning, and multimodal learning. As the field develops, I see my primary interest shifting to whatever fascinates me the most and whatever I believe to yield the highest possible long-term impact.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not working, I love working out, climbing, and running. I also enjoy spending time exploring other disciplines - including psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and physics. At my core, I am a philosophical scientist seeking to understand the universe we live in.
